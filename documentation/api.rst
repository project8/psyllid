API
##########

Users interact with Psyllid using with `Dripline-standard <https://github.com/project8/dripline>`_ requests.

The API documentation below is organized into requests that are part of the Dripline standard, and those that are Psyllid-specific.  They are further divided by request type: RUN, GET, SET, and CMD.

The routing key should consist of the server queue name, followed by the Routing Key Specifier (RKS): `[queue].[RKS]`.

For each request type, the API includes the allowed RKS, Payload options, and contents of the Reply Payload.

**<batch-command-key>**
All keys listed in the `batch-commands` node of the configuration are bound as command names and may be called.
These add one or more commands to the batch_executor queue; the return code indicates only that the actions were queued, nothing about their execution status.
The command ``hard-abort`` is defined in the default server_config to execute ``stop-run``.


Dripline Requests
=================

OP_GET
^^^^^^

.. toggle-header::
    :header: ``is-locked``

    Returns whether or not the server is locked out.

    *Reply Payload*

    - ``is-locked=[true/false (bool)]``


OP_CMD
^^^^^^

.. toggle-header::
    :header: ``lock``

    Requests that the server lockout be enabled. Nothing is done if already locked.

    *Reply Payload*

    - ``key=[UUID (string)]`` -- lockout key required for any lockable requests as long as the lock remains enabled
    - ``tag=[lockout tag (object)]`` -- information about the client that requested that the lock be enabled

.. toggle-header::
    :header: ``unlock``

    Requests that the server lockout be disabled.

    *Payload*

    - ``force=[true (bool)]`` -- *(optional)* Disables the lockout without a key.

.. toggle-header::
    :header: ``ping``

    Check that the server receives requests and sends replies. No other action is taken.

.. toggle-header::
    :header: ``set_condition``

    Cause the server to move to some defined state as quickly as possible; Psyllid implements conditions 10 and 12, both of which stop any ongoing run.
    _Note:_ set_condition is expected to be a broadcast command (routing key target is `broadcast` not `<psyllid-queue>`).

    *Payload*

    - ``values=[condition (int)]`` -- the integer condition


Psyllid Requests
================

OP_RUN
^^^^^^

The `run` message type is used to start a run.

All `run` requests are lockable.

.. toggle-header::
    :header: Details

    There are no Routing Key Specifiers for *run* requests.

    *Payload*

    - ``filename: [filename (string)]`` -- *(optional)* Filename for ``file_number`` 0.
    - ``filenames: [array of filenames (string)]`` -- *(optional)* Filenames for all files specified. Overrides ``filename``.
    - ``description: [description (string)]`` -- *(optional)* Text description for ``file_number`` 0; saved in the file header.
