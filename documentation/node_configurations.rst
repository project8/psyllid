  - "port": uint -- UDP port to listen on for packets

Transformers
------------

``event_builder``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Keeps track of the state of the packet sequence (is-triggered, or not).

When going from *untriggered* to *triggered*, adds some number of pretrigger packets.
Includes a skip tolerance for untriggered packets between two triggered packets.

In untriggered state, the *flag* and the *high_threshold* variables of the trigger flags are checked.
Only if both are true the event builder switches state.
If *f_n_triggers > 1* the next state is collecting_triggers, otherwise triggered.
In collecting_triggers state the event builder counts the incomming trigger flags with *flag =  true*.
Only if this *count == f_n_triggers* the state is switched to triggered.

Events are built by switching some untriggered packets to triggered packets according to the pretrigger and skip-tolerance parameters. Continuous sequences of triggered packets constitute events.

Parameter setting is not thread-safe.  Executing is thread-safe.

The cofigurable value *time-lengt* in the ``tf_roach_receiver`` must be set to a value greater than *pretrigger* and *skip-tolerance* (+5 is advised).
Otherwise the time domain buffer gets filled and blocks further packet processing.

* Type: ``event-builder``
* Configuration

  - "length": uint -- The size of the output buffer
  - "pretrigger": uint -- Number of packets to include in the event before the first triggered packet
  - "skip-tolerance": uint -- Number of untriggered packets to include in the event between two triggered packets
  - "n-triggers": uint -- Number of trigger flags with flag == true required before switching to triggered state

* Input

  * 0: ``trigger_flag``

* Output

  * 0: ``trigger_flag``

``frequency_mask_trigger``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The FMT has two modes of operation: updating the mask, and triggering.

When switched to the "updating" mode, the existing mask is erased, and the subsequent spectra that are passed to the FMT are used to calculate the new mask. The number of spectra used for the mask is configurable.  Those spectra are summed together as they arrive. Once the appropriate number of spectra have been used, the average value is calculated, and the mask is multiplied by the threshold SNR (assuming the data are amplitude values, not power).

In triggering mode, each arriving spectrum is compared to the mask bin-by-bin.  If a bin crosses the threshold, the spectrum passes the trigger and the bin-by-bin comparison is stopped.

It is possible to set a second threshold (*threshold-power-snr-high*).
In this case a second mask is calculated for this threshold and the incoming spectra are compared to both masks.
The output trigger flag has an additional variable *high_threshold* which is set true if the higher threshold led to a trigger. This variable is always set to true if only one trigger level is used.

The mask can be written to a JSON file via the *write_mask()* function.  The format for the file is:

*{   "timestamp": "[timestamp]", "n-packets": [number of packets averaged], "mask": [value_0, value_1, . . . .]     }*

Parameter setting is not thread-safe.  Executing (including switching modes) is thread-safe.
