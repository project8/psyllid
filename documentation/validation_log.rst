Validation Log
==============

Guidelines
----------

* All new features incorporated into a tagged release should have their validation documented.
  * Document the new feature.
  * Perform tests to validate the new feature.
  * If the feature is slated for incorporation into official DAQ processing, perform tests to show that the official configuration works and benefits from this feature.
  * Indicate in this log where to find documentation of the new feature.
  * Indicate in this log what tests were performed, and where to find a writeup of the results.
* Fixes to existing features should also be validated.
  * Perform tests to show that the fix solves the problem that had been indicated.
  * Perform tests to shwo that the fix does not cause other problems.
  * Indicate in this log what tests were performed and how you know the problem was fixed.

Release Date: January 11, 2018
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

New Features:
'''''''''''''

* Option to use monarch or not in daq_control
    * Includes dripline get and set functions under the RKS `use-monarch`.
    * API documentation has been updated.
    * If the option is `false` and during a run a writer attempts to write to a Monarch file, Psyllid will crash.
    * Validated by demonstrating that no file is written if the option is `false` (no incoming data; standard streaming 1-channel socket config).
* Auto-building documentation system added
    * Creates a website on readthedocs.org
    * Uses previous documentation content
  
Fixes:
''''''

* Pretrigger implementation in event_builder
    * boost::circular buffer used to implement the pretrigger buffer instead of std::deque.
    * Validated using the ROACH simulator.

* Stream-closing on node exit
    * Writers perform a final attempt to close a stream when they exit.
    * Validated by inserting code to purposefully crash a node.

* Validation log
    * This file, documentation/validation_log.md, was added to record changes to Psyllid as they're made.
    * No validation is needed as this is not a functional change.
  
Fixes:
''''''

* Propagate missing header values to subsequent files
    * Previously-missing information included voltage offset and range, DAC gain, and frequency min and range.
    * Validated by with a run producing multiple files using the roach_simulator.
  
* Prevent invalid duration setting
    * Setting the duration to 0 caused undefined behavior. This could occur if the value of the duration setting in a dripline request was not an unsigned integer.
    * Now the duration is extracted and checked for validity.  So far it just checks that it's not 0.
    * This was validated by by attempting to set the duration to 0.  It failed, which was a successful test.
